Various methods are being explored for breast cancer detection, including the use of human urine to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as potential biomarkers, mass spectrometric analysis of urinary VOCs, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Radical Basis Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, as well as embedded sensors with ultra-sensitive microbio heat and IoT technology for real-time data analysis. While these methods show promise, challenges remain in terms of training machines effectively and accurately identifying cancer stages. Additionally, techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) are being tested for breast cancer classification using deep machine learning with real medical images, though limitations exist regarding data diversity and confusion among modern techniques.
